This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This app is created for party-gathering purposes. You can add new guests (and checking, would they come alone or with a friend)
Also, by double-clicking on the name you can change it, if you mistyped your friend's name.
There is pretty shit layout, but someday I'll fix it
You can test it on: https://test-party-list.herokuapp.com/

Have fun!


Soom, I'll add filters to divide those, who are alonies and those who are  coming with guests. And of course - button, to <s>conquer</s> gather them all
